# Pig Game

## Description
Pig Game is a simple dice rolling game where two players compete to reach a total score of 100 points first. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated in that round, and it becomes the next player's turn. The game continues until one player reaches 100 points and wins the game.

This project is my first web development project using JavaScript, which I developed as part of my studies at Grit Academy. It's an opportunity for me to apply the JavaScript programming skills I've learned in a practical project.
